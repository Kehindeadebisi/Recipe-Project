        <h3>About Jollof Rice</h3>
        <p>Also known as benachin and thieboudienne, jollof rice is a one-pot meal that originated from the Wolof tribe in the 14th century. <br>Wolof Empire, ruling parts of modern-day Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, popularized jollof throughout West Africa. </p>
        <p>Although jollof rice was traditionally cooked with fish for dinner, Africans today also enjoy this savory dish for breakfast and lunch, <br> often substitute fish with chicken, beef or goat.</p>
        <p>Each country has added its own spin to the recipe and West Africans engage in humorous banter over who makes the best jollof. <br>friendly rivalries, known as the “Jollof Wars,” have become an African cultural phenomenon. </p>
